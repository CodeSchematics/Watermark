# Watermark
A simple Java program that adds a text overlay (watermark) to an image. Can be used to quickly create a watermarked image without the need for an image editor.

Select a PNG image and click import to load the image and display a preview. After entering the desired text for the watermark, you can change the name of the image file or use the default name with "-watermark" appended. The new image will be saved to your machine after clicking the "Mark it" button.
